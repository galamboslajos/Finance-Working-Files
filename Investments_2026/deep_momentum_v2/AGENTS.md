# Deep Momentum V2 working instructions

Read README.md, docs/RESEARCH_PLAN.md and docs/DATA_STATUS.md before work here.
For features, labels, models or portfolios, also read
docs/PAPER_REFERENCE_HAN_QIN_2026.md and docs/US_REPLICATION_PLAN.md. Apply the
repository-local .agents/skills/han-qin-deep-momentum/SKILL.md when relevant.

- This is a U.S. equity project. Keep new code and outputs in this directory.
- Preserve ../deep_momentum/ as an observation and navigation reference.
- Use the existing Finance-Working-Files Git repository; do not create nested Git repos.
- Keep raw data, credentials, paper PDFs, source snapshots and generated outputs
  outside Git. Publish original methodological notes, not the downloaded PDF.
- Treat reference/sadig_us_recovery/ as a pinned reference, not our active code.
- The locked Han-Qin paper uses monthly ten-class probability prediction,
  XGBoost and RET reclassification. It does not require an LSTM or Sharpe-loss
  neural network. Added features and forest ensembles are intended extensions;
  distinguish them from the paper baseline and isolate their effects.
- Use the paper reference's exact momentum indexing, 16-feature count,
  expanding annual classifier history, 100-fit probability averaging and
  trailing ten-year class payoffs. Do not invent missing author parameters.
- Distinguish source fields, engineered features and model-ready panels.
  Historical capitalization is missing from the current local source schemas;
  do not substitute price or dollar volume for the paper's size feature.
- Use stable security IDs and dated membership. Record identity, adjustment,
  missing-price and corporate-action limitations from the prior U.S. attempt.
  Future quote availability must not determine signal-time eligibility.
- Keep PAPER, INTERPRETATION, VERIFIED LOCAL, PROPOSED and OPEN claims separate.
  Paper-reading completion is not empirical replication or a frozen protocol.
- Freeze formulas, timing, eligibility, chronology, costs and trial bounds before
  results. Do not inspect protected 2024+ financial values unless a new research
  protocol explicitly authorizes that access.
- Small local metadata/sample checks are appropriate. Full feature builds and
  backtests must follow an agreed execution plan. Cloud compute, GCS writes,
  IAM changes and deletions need their applicable authorization and policies.
  Registered-repository cloud mutations use quant-gcp-ops gcp-run.
