## Introduction

This document outlines the implementation of an Opening Range Breakout
(ORB) strategy using 5-minute intraday data for the NASDAQ-100 ETF
(QQQ). The strategy is designed to capture price movements based on the
opening range of the first two 5-minute candles after market open.

The idea to test such approach comes from [a study by Carlo Zarattini,
Andrea Barbon, Andrew Aziz
(2024)](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4729284).

## Data

Data has been gethered from the EOD API and saved as a Parquet file. The
dataset contains 5-minute OHLCV data for QQQ, including datetime, open,
high, low, close, volume, and ticker information.

The timezone is set to ‚ÄúAmerica/New_York‚Äù to align with the NASDAQ
trading hours.

The time span goes from 2020-10-09 to 2025-05-21.

## Returns on the NASDAQ ETF is taken as a benchmark for the strategy performance evaluation

## Applying the Strategy

1.  The direction of each trade (long or short) was determined by the
    initial movement of the opening range.
2.  The stop loss was placed at the low of the day (which was the low of
    the first 5-minute candle) for a long trade, and at the high of the
    day (which was the high of the first 5-minute candle) for a short
    trade.
3.  The distance between the entry price and the stop is labeled as
    Risk($R). Returns are also evaluated based on their multiple of
    this.
4.  We set the profit to the end of the day **(EoD)**, we liquidated the
    position at market closure.
5.  We assumed a starting capital of $100,000, a maximum leverage of
    **10x**, and a commission of $0.0005/share traded.

## Position Sizing

Position sizing proved to be a choke point of the strategy, as it is
crucial to determine how many shares to buy or sell based on the
available capital and risk per trade.

The position size is calculated using the following formula (same as in
the paper):

-   `A` ‚Äì current account equity (`current_capital`)  
-   `p` ‚Äì `risk_per_trade_pct` (here 0.01 = 1 %)  
-   `L` ‚Äì `max_leverage` (here 10)  
-   `P` ‚Äì entry price  
-   `R` ‚Äì `risk_per_share`

**Key properties**

-   Fixed-fractional: each position risks exactly **1 % of equity**.  
-   Hard leverage ceiling: total exposure never exceeds **10 √ó
    equity**.  
-   Whole-share only: `floor()` ensures no fractional shares.  
-   Adaptive: position size automatically shrinks when the stop is wide
    and grows when the stop is tight, but never breaches either risk or
    leverage limits.

### Strategy Equity Curve vs.¬†Buy & Hold Benchmark

The top panel shows the evolution of capital for:

-   **Strategy** (blue line): performance of the active trading system.
-   **Buy & Hold QQQ** (orange dashed line): a passive benchmark for
    comparison.

The active strategy significantly outperforms the benchmark, especially
from 2023 onward, although it shows more volatility and deeper
pullbacks.

### Drawdown Over Time

The second panel displays the strategy‚Äôs **drawdowns** ‚Äî the percentage
decline from peak equity:

-   Red shaded areas indicate capital drawdowns.
-   The strategy experienced several deep drawdowns (as much as
    **-30%**), especially in 2021 and 2023.
-   The drawdowns appear to stabilize somewhat toward 2025, reflecting
    improved robustness.

### 50-Day Rolling Alpha and Beta

The bottom panel plots **rolling 50-day CAPM alpha and beta**:

-   **Alpha (blue line)**: Measures excess return beyond what is
    explained by exposure to the QQQ index.
    -   It is annualized (√ó252) and fluctuates meaningfully around the
        global mean (dashed blue line).
-   **Beta (orange line)**: Measures sensitivity to the benchmark.
    -   A beta above 1 implies high exposure to market risk. A beta near
        0 indicates market neutrality.
-   Both alpha and beta are volatile, but the average alpha is slightly
    positive, and beta remains relatively low, suggesting consistent
    **market-independent outperformance**.

These rolling measures provide insight into how the strategy‚Äôs
**exposures and return premiums change over time**.

Rate](ORB_attempt1.markdown_strict_files/figure-markdown_strict/unnamed-chunk-8-1.png)

### 1. 50-Day Rolling Sharpe Ratio

This plot shows the strategy‚Äôs Sharpe ratio over a 50-day rolling
window.

-   Values above 0 indicate positive risk-adjusted returns.
-   Dips below 0 reflect periods of poor performance relative to
    volatility.
-   Sharpe falls sharply in 2021 and mid-2023 but stabilizes by 2025.
-   Useful for tracking how consistently the strategy rewards risk over
    time.

### 2. Net Monthly PnL

This bar chart shows the net profit or loss for each calendar month.

-   Positive bars show profitable months; negative bars show losses.
-   Profits spike in some months (e.g.¬†late 2022 and 2024), reaching
    ~$60,000.
-   Losses are also present, occasionally exceeding -$20,000.
-   Reveals the cyclical nature of the strategy‚Äôs performance.

### 3. 50-Day Rolling Win Rate

This plot tracks the percentage of winning trades in a 50-day window.

-   The dashed line at 50% is the breakeven level.
-   The win rate mostly stays between 15% and 40%.
-   Indicates a strategy that wins less often but may have favorable
    risk/reward.
-   Useful for understanding trade structure and consistency.

## The model‚Äôs accuracy in directional term (initial direction is accurate for day‚Äôs direction)

The following metric shows the overall directional accuracy of the
model. If, in a certain trading day the model went short, we can expect
the closing candle‚Äôs closing price level to be smaller than the first
candle‚Äôs closing price level (conversely in a long-case).

    Directional success count: 365 out of 723 trading days

    Directional accuracy rate: 50.48 %

![](ORB_attempt1.markdown_strict_files/figure-markdown_strict/unnamed-chunk-10-1.png)

The histogram chart shows the mean and the distribution of **winning**
returns (in terms of R) on the trades over time.

It looks like that the distribution has a long right tail, which is a
good sign for the strategy. The mean of the winning trades is around 9R,
which means that the average winning trade returns 9 times the risk
taken.

### Selected Trade Case Studies

This panel showcases four notable individual trades from the backtest,
with price action annotated by:

-   üîµ **Entry point**
-   üü° **Exit point**
-   üî¥ **Stop level** (horizontal dashed line)

Each subplot highlights a different performance scenario:

**üü• Biggest Loser ‚Äî 2025-04-21**  
- A long trade that quickly moved against the entry. - The stop loss was
hit early in the session, leading to the largest dollar loss in the
dataset.

**üü© Long Winner ‚Äî 2025-04-09**  
- A long breakout trade that trended upward for the rest of the day. -
Captured strong upside momentum, exiting with a large gain.

**üü¶ Short Winner ‚Äî 2025-03-13**  
- A short trade executed after a bearish ORB setup. - Price continued to
decline, producing one of the most profitable short-side trades.

**üü® Top R (1137.14) ‚Äî 2021-12-16**  
- This trade had the **highest R-multiple** (return relative to risk
taken). - The tight stop enabled a very high return with relatively
small capital exposure. - A textbook example of **asymmetric payoff**.

These visualizations provide intuitive insight into trade dynamics ‚Äî
showcasing how both risk and reward evolve intraday.

## Conclusion

The Opening Range Breakout strategy applied to the NASDAQ-100 ETF (QQQ)
using 5-minute intraday data has shown potential for generating alpha
returns. However, the overall performance, as measured by the Sharpe
ratio and other metrics, indicates that the strategy may require
improvements in terms of risk management and position sizing. The
strategy‚Äôs reliance on the opening range and the subsequent price action
has yielded some profitable trades, but the volatility and drawdowns
suggest that further refinement is needed to enhance its robustness and
consistency.
