# **Identifying the Best Consumer Stock for Portfolio Allocation**

## **Project Overview**  
This project evaluates the performance of leading **consumer staples and consumer discretionary** stocks to determine the best candidate for portfolio allocation. The selection includes ten major consumer-focused companies with strong market presence and historical performance data:

- **Procter & Gamble (PG)**
- **Coca-Cola (KO)**
- **PepsiCo (PEP)**
- **Walmart (WMT)**
- **Costco Wholesale (COST)**
- **Mondelez International (MDLZ)**
- **McDonald's (MCD)**
- **Home Depot (HD)**
- **Nike (NKE)**
- **Starbucks (SBUX)**

## **Objective**  
The goal of this project is to determine the **best-performing consumer stock** for portfolio allocation by evaluating each company’s **risk-adjusted return**. The analysis focuses on three key financial metrics:

- **Annualized Expected Return**: The average return generated by the stock over the given period (2010-2024), adjusted for annualization.
- **Annualized Risk (Standard Deviation)**: The volatility of each stock’s returns, measured as the standard deviation of daily returns scaled to an annual basis.
- **Sharpe Ratio**: A measure of risk-adjusted performance that compares each stock’s excess return (above the risk-free rate) to its volatility. A higher Sharpe ratio indicates a better risk-reward tradeoff.

## **Methodology**  
- **Data Collection**: Historical adjusted closing prices were retrieved for all ten stocks from Yahoo Finance, covering the period from 2010 to 2024.  
- **Risk-Free Rate**: A fixed **4.5%** risk-free rate was manually set for calculating excess returns.  
- **Sharpe Ratio Ranking**: Stocks were ranked in descending order based on their Sharpe ratio, identifying the best-performing stock in terms of risk-adjusted return.

## **Outcome**  
By comparing expected returns, risks, and Sharpe ratios, the project identifies which of these leading consumer stocks presents the best opportunity for portfolio allocation. The stock with the **highest Sharpe ratio** will be considered the most attractive choice, offering the best tradeoff between return and risk in the consumer sector.

Based on the ranking of Sharpe Ratios, **Costco (COST)** emerges as the best-performing consumer stock for portfolio allocation, offering the highest risk-adjusted return at **0.8463**.
