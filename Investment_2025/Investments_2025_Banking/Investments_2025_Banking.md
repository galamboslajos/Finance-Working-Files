# **Identifying the Best Bank Stock for Portfolio Allocation**

## **Project Overview**  
This project evaluates the performance of leading banking and financial sector stocks to determine the best candidate for portfolio allocation. The selection includes ten major financial institutions with strong market presence and historical performance data:

- **JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM)**
- **Bank of America Corporation (BAC)**
- **Wells Fargo & Company (WFC)**
- **Citigroup Inc. (C)**
- **Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (GS)**
- **Morgan Stanley (MS)**
- **U.S. Bancorp (USB)**
- **PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. (PNC)**
- **Toronto-Dominion Bank (TD)**
- **Charles Schwab Corporation (SCHW)**

## **Objective**  
The goal of this project is to determine the **best-performing banking stock** for portfolio allocation by evaluating each company’s **risk-adjusted return**. The analysis focuses on three key financial metrics:

- **Annualized Expected Return**: The average return generated by the stock over the given period (2010-2024), adjusted for annualization.
- **Annualized Risk (Standard Deviation)**: The volatility of each stock’s returns, measured as the standard deviation of daily returns scaled to an annual basis.
- **Sharpe Ratio**: A measure of risk-adjusted performance that compares each stock’s excess return (above the risk-free rate) to its volatility. A higher Sharpe ratio indicates a better risk-reward tradeoff.

## **Methodology**  
- **Data Collection**: Historical adjusted closing prices were retrieved for all ten stocks from Yahoo Finance, covering the period from 2010 to 2024.  
- **Risk-Free Rate**: The 10-year U.S. Treasury yield (put manually at 4,50%) was used as the benchmark for calculating excess returns.  
- **Sharpe Ratio Ranking**: Stocks were ranked in descending order based on their Sharpe ratio, identifying the best-performing stock in terms of risk-adjusted return.

## **Outcome**  
By comparing expected returns, risks, and Sharpe ratios, the project identifies which of these leading financial stocks presents the best opportunity for portfolio allocation. The stock with the **highest Sharpe ratio** will be considered the most attractive choice, offering the best tradeoff between return and risk in the banking sector.

Based on the ranking of Sharpe Ratios, **JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM)** emerges as the best-performing banking stock for portfolio allocation, offering the highest risk-adjusted return at **0.4237**.
