# Description

In a [previous
file](https://github.com/galamboslajos/Finance-Working-Files/blob/main/Investment_2025/Index_Modelling.md),
we tried out multiple methods to come up with precise prediction results
for Nasdaq 100 daily returns (direction: +/-). This time we want to
implement those results form the most accurate Logistic Regression model
to a more automated process. We will work with code that feeds the model
with new data and returns the predictions.
