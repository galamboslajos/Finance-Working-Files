# Finance-Working-Files

Welcome to the **Finance-Working-Files** repository! This collection is dedicated to finance and investment-related files aimed at analysis and modeling.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into the following directories:

- **Investment_2025**: Contains textbook examples of mean-variance portfolio optimisation, elementary intraday trading framework on the Nasdaq index, some further analysis, fundamental (DCF) approach and simplistic time series analysis. 
- **Investment_2026**: This repository contains my recent project in which I engage with new investment framework inspired by [Kirstensen, Vorobets](https://fortitudo.tech).
